# Car Lease Calculator App

[![Car Lease & Finance Calculator App](/demo-image.png)](https://bit.ly/DealCalc)

A car lease & finance calculator web app for easily knowing whether you're getting a good deal on a lease.

## How It Works

See it in action: [bit.ly/DealCalc](https://bit.ly/DealCalc).

Simply enter your lease or finance numbers. The app calculates your monthly payment as well as other important information like total lease cost, total interest paid, etc. It also flags the deal's parameters that are less than ideal. The web app is built on top of [Lease-Calculator](https://github.com/ErezNagar/lease-calculator).
