[![Car Lease Calculator App](/demo-image.png)](https://bit.ly/DealCalc)

A car lease calculator web app for easily knowing whether you're getting a good deal on a lease.

## How It Works

See it in action: [bit.ly/DealCalc](https://bit.ly/DealCalc).

Simply enter your lease numbers. The app calculates your monthly payment & total lease cost and can flag the deal's parameters that are less than ideal. Built on top of [Lease-Calculator](https://github.com/ErezNagar/lease-calculator).
